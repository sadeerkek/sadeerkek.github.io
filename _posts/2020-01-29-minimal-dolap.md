## 7 Yatirim – Erkegin Dolabi

A sharp go-anywhere suit is essential in any professional men’s minimalist wardrobe (make that any man’s wardrobe, period).

Charcoal is a steadfast choice, but if you’re only investing in one, make it navy so the jacket can double as another men’s wardrobe essential, the navy blazer.
